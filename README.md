# syscall-alt

[syscall-alt] is a rust crate that provides inline assembler (`asm!` macro) definitions of syscalls for some Linux platforms. It also includes:-

* An enum defining common Linux syscalls;
* Some minor wrapper logic to make straightforward to work with syscalls.
* Correct Syscall / Posix error codes ('E'), eg `EINVAL`
	* Linux:-
		* These differ slightly on MIPS and PowerPC
		* MIPS64 is the same as MIPS
		* PowerPC64 is the same as PowerPC
		* PowerPC is ***nearly*** identical to x86_64 bar `EDEADLOCK`:-
			* PowerPC is the only platform on which `EDEADLOCK != EDEADLK` (so watch out when using `match`)
		* MIPS is ***very*** different to x86_64
			* But it has ***exactly*** the same set of E numbers
* SYS call numbers and E numbers are available for every arch, eg if you want to know them for `arm`, but are compiled for `x86_64`, they are available
	* Watch out if using `EDEADLOCK`, `EDEADLCK`, `ENOTSUP` and `EOPNOTSUPP`; these vary in definition and value, sometimes being missing, sometimes being equal
	* Take a little care with `EWOULDBLOCK` and `EAGAIN`; all current platforms make `EWOULDBLOCK` the same as `EAGAIN`, but this isn't required by POSIX
* A windows stub, which contains EAGAIN, etc, as defined on Windows (but no syscall numbers)

The code is very much 'early-days', so expect breaking changes.

This crate is `#[!no_std]`, and does not require the `std` library or the `libc` crate


## TODO

* syscalls are not actually implemented for Linux mips, mips64, powerpc, powerpc64, or s390x but could be by tring to use musl's `syscall_arch.h` headers (bar s390x)
* We could implement iOS ARM 32-bit syscalls; see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4371897/arm-darwin-assembly-looking-for-system-calls-tutorial-perhaps> for ideas
* Support ARM and ARM64 for the BSDs as and when rust gains support for them
* Syscalling is not implemented for Solaris, and won't ever be implemented for Windows
