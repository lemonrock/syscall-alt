# syscall-alt

[syscall-alt] is a rust crate that provides inline assembler (`asm!` macro) definitions of syscalls for some Linux platforms. It also includes:-

* An enum defining common Linux syscalls;
* Some minor wrapper logic to make straightforward to work with syscalls.

The code is very much 'early-days', so expect breaking changes.
